## Customizable fractal tree 

A fractal tree is a recursive tree-like structure that exhibits self-similarity at different scales. The branches of a fractal tree are created by repeatedly splitting and reducing the size of the branches, creating a natural-looking tree-like structure.

To generate a fractal tree, you will need a starting point (the base of the tree), an angle of branching, and a branching factor. The branching factor determines how many branches will be created at each level of the tree, and the angle of branching determines the angle at which the branches will be created.

This program provides an intuitively customizable tree, Users can use the arrows to control the branching factor and the angle of branching in run time to design different structures with varying complexity. <br> <br>
